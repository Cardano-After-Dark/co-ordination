## How to work in Github
This repo is for coordination with the Team

To organise asynchronous work, please use issues for tasks or just ideas - don't worry about optics issues can be edited, moved to discussions or (by Patrik, Cem and me) deleted!
If you go to 'Projects' you can create kanban-boards for your Area of work and plan such.

there are documents in the repository which you are free to edit and add to:

* [Dictionary](dictionary.md) - building common language for clear understanding and communication.
* [Docs](docs)
    * [Texas-hold-em](docs/texas-hold-em.md)
    * [Architecture](docs/architecture.md)

we have meetings every 2nd Monday 17:00 UTC starting 13-12-2021.


## What is this Project about?

Building a real-life poker dapp with low fees and non-custodial wallets for the poker-community as well as demonstrate the power and empowerment Cardano can bring to future applications and Systems.

Also we would like for this project to be educational not just for us but for the community as a whole, which is just one more reason as to why we should do our best to document the processes.
